				<p>Hello, I’m Wietske Nutma. I’m a multidisciplinary designer and researcher with a focus on ecology and the more-than-human – in an effort to find ways to contribute to the living world. I spend most of my time working for <a href="https://zoop.earth">Zoöp</a> at the Zoönomic Institute, and various other projects at <a href="https://nieuweinstituut.nl">Nieuwe Instituut</a>. <br>I also work a lot with <a href="gallery.html">textile, wool and other fibers</a>, whilst thinking, learning and researching cloth making and repair.</p>

				<h2 class="post-title">Merchant and Mill's Florence Top</h2>
				<p class="body-text"><b>22.02.2026</b><br>This top has been on my to-make list for a while. I was inspired by the buttons on these bed sheets I have from IKEA. Every time I looked at the cloth covered buttons I thought that it would be so cute if they could be used as a button closure for a shirt of the same fabric. That's almost a year ago now, but my top is finally finished. I just have to wait for warmer weather to wear it now.</p><br>
