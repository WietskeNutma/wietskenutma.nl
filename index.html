			I am Wietske, a recent Graphic Design graduate from the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. <br> I am exploring topics and questions, often with socio-political focus, through writing as well as graphic design. My work is marked by a constant search for interaction between the analog and the digital. For my final exam <span style="font-weight:bold">'Do You Read Me?! The route of a text message' </span> I created an installation that examines the contrast between how we perceive digital communication and the technology that regulates it, by taking the route of a single text message between sender and receiver as a case study. I'm passionate about things such as printmaking and bookbinding and love to read. <br><br> 
			Ps: This digital reflection of me will soon get an update, more info, pictures, projects coming
