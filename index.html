				<p>Hello, I’m Wietske Nutma. I’m a multidisciplinary designer and researcher with a focus on ecology and the more-than-human – in an effort to find ways to contribute to the living world. I spend most of my time working for Zoöp at the Zoönomic Institute, and various other projects at Nieuwe Instituut. <br>I also work a lot with textile, wool and other fibers, whilst thinking, learning and researching on repair.</p>

				<p class="body-text"><b>1. Row's Wave Vest</b><br>During the Christmas Break I casted on for the Wave Vest by Rows Knitwear. I have never really worked in a pattern before (and if I do it's mostly knit & purl combinations for edging or colourwork). This pattern here really plays with the structure of the stitch and asks you to go back a few rows to pick up a loop here and there.</p>

				<p class="body-text">Alice (the designer) said the stitch pattern was inspired by the Hokusai print; The Great Wave. I can sort of see a cresting wave in there, but it's most obvious to me on the back of the work where you can see rows and rows of these wavy lines.</p>

				<p class="caption">Back of the vest, before construction</p>
				<p class="body-text">I love the back almost as much as the front and wish I could've made it reversible somehow. It was a joy to knit anyway and the contrast between the different patterns of the main body and the edges is really beautiful.</p>

				<p class="body-text"><b>2. Laurel’s shirt</b><br>Back in October Laurel visited Rotterdam. When we met in Copenhagen for Naive Yearly she told me about this much loved shirt she bought 8 years ago which is now quite worn. And how she was dreaming of creating a pattern for it or replicating its essence somehow.<br><br>When she came to R'dam she brought the shirt with her to show me. We talked a great deal about clothing and identity and how clothes support the various roles we play in life, the people we aspire to be, or the character traits we'd like to have when we wear them. Similar to how I have always opted wearing the same boxy buttoned-up shirt whenever I feel nervous about the day ahead. That shirt has become a uniform of sorts, providing a sense of reassurance and making me feel more ok.</p>

				<p class="body-text">It was really nice to reflect together on the use of her garment, the energy it carries, and what it would mean to recreate it. She has loved and worn it for years now and along the way the shirt acquired some stains that can't be removed, a few holes here and there and some of the buttons have faded or went missing.</p>

				<p class="body-text"><b>3. Merchant and Mill's Ellis Dress</b><br>Making this piece was a bit of a spontaneous decision and I didn't really plan for it to happen. Merchant and Mill's recently released a 'hack' to one of their dress patterns (the Ellis dress) which adapted the style and added a full sleeve and placket and 'let down' tucks on the skirt. There are instructions for the hack but ultimately it comes down to you redrawing parts of the pattern.<br><br>The image of what I wanted this dress to become, the color, and its design got stuck in my head, and every time I closed my eyes I saw it taking shape. I did not plan to do anything else except sew for 2 days straight during a weekend, and that's the time it took to come together. </p>

				<p class="body-text"><b>4. Row's Outline Sweater</b><br>Upon completing the Wave Vest, I started another pattern crafted by the same maker. The construction of her pieces are really beautiful and I love the details that make it a bit more special. You knit the the jumper in two flat pieces that are then joined with a visible seam done on a crochet hook.</p>

				<p class="body-text">A project like this one requires a lot of wool, and picking what yarn to knit with is very important to me. Something that takes a significant amount of time to make needs to sit right on your body, and I want to know it came from a good place. I read this wonderful book a while ago titled: "Worn. A people's history of clothing" which essentially traces clothing and textiles over the world back to their origin and the people that craft the material. I think it can often be tempting to rely on notions of ‘globalisation’ to normalise the fiction that the object's origin are simply too complex to understand, but this book does a great job at demystifying the places, people and practices that are involved in making the clothes that we buy.<br><br>There was this one short paragraph that really struck me whilst reading, it said:<br>"Clothing signals place. Like pride in a local dish, local cloth had historically been used to display hometown identity. This "Wisconsin" t-shirt might serve the same function for its wearer, but it is also a product from South India. It has left its residues there. It has taken its debt from there in the form of water."<br>What interests me is the notion of debt that is used here. In Robin Wall Kimmerer’s book “Braiding Sweetgrass” I read a lot about reciprocal relations and how we must always give back if we take something, to have a fair and caring exchange. In the case of this jumper, the wool and its fabrication process, the designer, and me (the maker), what does that mean? And how can I make these various relationships and the making process in itself a reciprocal one?<br><br>I'll continue to ponder this question, and I hope I'll find an answer someday. I think I'd like to try and execute all the steps in the making of a jumper myself. Maybe it sounds silly but I'd like to get to know the animal whose wool I'm wearing and how to take care of them, I'd like to sheer a sheep, wash the wool, spin the yarn, knit the jumper and to get to know the people that are experts in these various fields of craft and do it for a living. In the meantime, whilst I continue to manifest this small dream on here and elsewhere, I have started knitting the Outline jumper with wool from a Yorkshire based company called Wooltrace. You can read all about them here, but in short they have created a fully traceable yarn that guarantees fair pay to farmers, ensures the welfare of their animals and supports sustainability within the British farming industry. You buy their yarn in hanks which means you have to wind them into balls or 'cakes' as I'd like to call them. Quite an enjoyable process.</p>

				<p class="caption">Picture of the winding process, and the finished 'cake', side by side</p>
				<p class="body-text">Because of the big needle size you need to knit the jumper (5mm) it comes together really fast. I'm excited to love and wear it and to take pride in this thing I have made not just because I have done so, but also because the material came from a good place. I want the finished item to have a good and honest energy.</p>
