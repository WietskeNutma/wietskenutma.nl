				<h2 class="post-title">Row's Wave Vest</h2>
				<p class="body-text">During the Christmas Break I casted on for the Wave Vest by Rows Knitwear. I have never really worked in a pattern before (and if I do it's mostly knit & purl combinations for edging or colourwork). This pattern here really plays with the structure of the stitch and asks you to go back a few rows to pick up a loop here and there.</p>

				<p class="body-text">Alice (the designer) said the stitch pattern was inspired by the Hokusai print; The Great Wave. I can sort of see a cresting wave in there, but it's most obvious to me on the back of the work where you can see rows and rows of these wavy lines.</p>

				<p class="body-text">I love the back almost as much as the front and wish I could've made it reversible somehow. It was a joy to knit anyway and the contrast between the different patterns of the main body and the edges is really beautiful.</p>
