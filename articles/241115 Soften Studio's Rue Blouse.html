				<h2 class="post-title">Soften Studio's Rue Blouse</h2>
				<p class="body-text">I bought this very lightweight checkered cloth 3 years back that was waiting to be made into a billowy blouse. I was doubting between 2 different patterns, the <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/eu/the-clover">Clover</a> and the <a href="https://softenstudio.com/products/rue-blouse-pdf-pattern-size-6-24">Rue Blouse</a>. I wasn't sure about the ruffled edge of the Rue Blouse, it felt a bit too cute, but I was a big fan of the raglan sleeves and the opening at the front. I decided to go for it in the end and I'm really happy with the result. It's a nice layering piece and I imagine it to be very airy/cool in the summer too.</p>
