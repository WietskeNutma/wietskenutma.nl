        <h2 class="post-title">The Modern Sewer Co.'s Rib Sweater</h2>
				<p class="body-text">For Ben's birthday last year I made him a jumper using teddy cloth. His birthday is in november, perfect season for warm jumpers, and teddy cloth is really good for that. Ever since I made his I wanted to make one of my own. I chose this lavender color with a matching rib.</p>

				<p class="body-text">I think I would've liked it a few sizes bigger but it's good to also have a jumper as part of my wardrobe that is a bit more close fitting.</p>
