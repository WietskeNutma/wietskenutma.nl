        <h2 class="post-title">Darn it!</h2>
				<p class="body-text">On the 24th of October I gave my first ever darning workshop titled "Darn it". I've been wanting to do this for such a long time but I was scared of teaching something and this was holding me back a bit. Together with my friend Emma (also member of <a href="http://extrapractice.space">Extra Practice</a>) I set a date so she could hold me to it (thank you Emma!). I was really happy that I could do it at Extra Practice as I don't have a studio or other big enough space myself. We spread all the info on their channels too and it was nice to see their network, and a couple of new people too, register for it.<br>I prepared a presentation on the history of darning, how to choose a needle and thread for your project, supplies, and of course how to darn. I always get so nervous whenever I have to present and this time was no different. But after that part was over with I started to feel more relaxed, I did a demo on a hole in a jersey t-shirt that I wanted to fix and after that I walked around the room and tried to help everyone with their projects. It was a really nice atmosphere with drinking tea, chatting and darning, and it made me feel like the workshop deserved a follow-up. Maybe I can organise a mending circle in the future, just a once-a-month gathering where you can drop in with your project and we can all repair our garments together. I would love that.<br><br>Ps: Emma also made the lovely invitation for Instagram, thank you!</p>
