				<h2 class="post-title">Mending Circle</h2>
				<p class="body-text"><b>10.07.2025</b><br>Last Thursday we gathered round at XP and sat next to the canal on the small dock to mend our clothes in the sun. Felix mended a hole in his pocket, Gijs continued darning his pair of socks, Ben fixed a whole in his trousers, and many other small or big projects were worked on.<br>Around us the sunny Thursday evening continued with sounds from the bars across the street, people sitting down to enjoy the warmth or walking past, with some passer-byes sneaking a peek at what we were doing. The group we were with continued to grow throughout the evening. I think some people turned up without something to fix but then found something on them that could use a bit of attention. That was really nice. I feel that most of my clothing could use an alteration or a fix but there's not always time. Having a few dedicated hours really helps, especially if we can support and cheer each other on whilst doing so.<br><br>Thanks to everyone for coming, and thanks Gijs for the beautiful photos you took! I think you captured the moment and the feeling that came with it really well.</p><br>
