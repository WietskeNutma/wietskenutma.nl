        <h2 class="post-title">Puff and Pencil's Tie Waist Blouse</h2>
				<p class="body-text">I found this pattern brand (<a href="https://puffandpencil.com">Puff & Pencil</a>) a while ago and I really like their designs. They are based in Copenhagen and the clothing they make reminds me a lot of what I saw people wear when I was visiting there last fall. Lots of elegant shapes.<br><br>This blouse falls over the hips and has channels in the waist area with a bit of string through them. You can use the strings to tighten the waist and to tie a bow at both sides. A very clever way to give some more shape to the garment, and I love love the bows.<br></p>

				<p class="body-text">I picked a sturdy black denim so that the garment would have some structure to it. The blouse has a lot of topstitch detailing and I thought it would look really nice with white thread. It also meant that I had be super neat when doing all of the stitching because it's so visible. I took my time here and it shows in the end result.
				<a href="https://puffandpencil.com/products/tie-waist-blouse-sewing-pattern">The pattern</a> doesn't include a lot of instruction on how to neaten the seams which confused me at first. I kept thinking this step would be explained later on only to have sewn pieces together and realised that I could no longer neaten the seams without taking it apart again (which I did end up doing, multiple times). I'll keep it in mind for next time though when working with patterns from this brand.</p>
