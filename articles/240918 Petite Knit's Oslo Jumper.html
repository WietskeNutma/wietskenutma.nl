        <h2 class="post-title">Petite Knit's Oslo Jumper</h2>
				<p class="body-text">Back in June I started knitting a stripy jumper for myself. I have a striped vest in red and brown that I really like and wanted to make a jumper with a similar design. Whilst I was thinking through the shape and the colours I would use two things happened: Petite Knit released a new pattern for a striped jumper, and Row's Knitwear posted a picture on their instagram of a top with a really lovely combination of two colours. Both of these things got stuck in my head and I got everything that I needed to start. </p>

				<p class="body-text">It was hard for me to get the tension right in the beginning and I unraveled my work several times before I was happy with the dimensions. The most painful moment was when I realised halfway through the bodice that I knit tighter in the round than I do when you go back and forth. I had to take everything out and use two different sized needles to compensate for this difference, a 4mm for knitting back and forth and a 4,5mm for knitting in the round. Taking it all apart so often resulted in a lot of loose ends that I needed to weave in but it was worth it. I'm really happy with the thickness of the stripes and how the colours look together. Just need to wait for some colder days to enjoy wearing it now.</p>
